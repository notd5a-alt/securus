# A Simple P2P chat application in Go

## Motivations
I wanted to improve my skills in the golang language and create something
while I was learning.
The idea behind this is that i want to make a chat application that's both in the command line
and allows for secure communication between 2 clients.

It's a fun idea and one that Go is suited for so i thought i would do it.
The overall idea is that eventually i can keep extending the chat backend and make
something quite serious out of it.

For now its a toy application and it will require some time but i do know that
it'll be fun developing it and figuring out how to perform P2P communications
through libraries or through a custom backend implementation of my own.
